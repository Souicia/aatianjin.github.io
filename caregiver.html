            The most important fact is that the patient should be respected, no
            matter how severe the condition is. Just because a person has
            received diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, doesn’t mean that they
            have lost the ability to think and communicate. Talk to the patient
            directly, and always show the same respect and share emotions with
            them.
